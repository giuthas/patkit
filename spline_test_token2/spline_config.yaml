  # Single spline file for all recordings (True) or one for each recording
  # (False).
  single_spline_file: False

  # Only one of the following will be in use.
  # If a single spline file, what is it called.
  spline_file: File003_splines.csv
  # If not a single spline, what glob pattern should be used to find the splines.
  # E.g. '*.csv'
  spline_file_extension: '_splines.csv'

  # Do the files have a header row?
  # Please note that possible header row information is ignored.
  headers: True

  # What delimiter does the file use. If left empty, this defaults to a tabulator.
  delimiter:

  # Either 'polar' or 'Cartesian' 
  coordinates: polar

  # Are the coordinates interleaved in 
  #  interleaved format (True): point1/x point1/y point2/x point2/y
  #  or non-interleaved (False): point1/x point2/x ... point1/y point2/y
  interleaved_coords: False

  # These are listed in order of appearance in the file. 
  # Please note that possible header row information is ignored.
  # Accepted values:
    # - ignore: marks a column to be ignored, unlike the others below, 
    #   can be used several times
    # - id: used to identify the speaker, 
    #   often contained in a csv field called 'family name'
    # - given names: appended to 'id' if not marked 'ignore'
    # - date and time: dat3 and time of recording
    # - prompt: prompt of recording, used to identify the recording with 'id'
    # - annotation label: optional field containing annotation information
    # - time in recording: timestamp of the frame this spline belongs to
    # - number of spline points: number of sample points in the spline used 
    #   to parse the coordinates and possible confidence information
  meta_columns:
    - id
    - date and time
    - time in recording
    - prompt
    - number of spline points

  # These will be either interleaved or not as specified by 'interleaved coords'.
  # Confidence values are always assumed to be non-interleaved.
  # Accepted values: 'r' with 'phi', 'x' with 'y', and 'confidence'
  data_columns:
    - r
    - phi
    - confidence

data_config:
  # How many points should be ignored at the front and at the end of a spline.
  # All of the data is always read in, This setting is used in plotting and
  # processing the splines. Defaults to 0 at front and 0 at back if not specified:
  # ignore_points:
  #   - 0
  #   - 0
  ignore_points:
  - 11
  - 0
