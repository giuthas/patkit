# SATKIT development guide

## Code conventions

These are a guidelines, not a ruleset.

First things first: write in good pythonic style.

- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) outlines the general
  style.
  - Most of these guidelines can be followed automatically by using the
    [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) and Pylint packages to
    format code.
- [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) talks about conventions
  for docstrings. In addition we might do the following:
  - Consider what will look good once the docs are compiled.
  - If we are using pdoc, repeating the same thing for a class docstring and
      the constructor is not a good idea. Instead, write general description in
      the class docstring and describe arguments and such in the constructor's
      docstring. This way they'll also make sense when reading the source.
  - Besides docstrings write other comments too.

Also follow the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) with
the following additions:

- Getting it done is better than making it perfect (because getting it perfect
  won't happen).
- A module is the unit of reuse. Ideally, a module should do something that
  gets used time and time again, but it is good enough if it does something
  which has a clear and self-contained purpose. Prefer splitting to smaller
  modules over piles of unrelated code.

## Packages and modules

In Python a module is -- [roughly
speaking](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages) -- any .py
file and a regular package is a directory that contains a `__init__.py` file
and possibly some other `.py` files. In SATKIT `__init__.py` files are used for
two purposes: Defining the public API of the module and running any
initialization that is needed. For an example have a look at
`satkit/__init__.py`.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning under the rules as set out
by [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) with the additional
understanding that releases before 1.0 (i.e. current releases at time of
writing) have not been tested in any way.

For the versions available, see the [tags on this
repository](https://github.com/giuthas/satkit/tags).

## SATKIT's branches

SATKIT uses gitflow as the branching convention (until we have a reason for
doing something else). This means we have the following kinds of branches:

- `main` is the release branch. Any update here after 1.0 will get its own
  version number and be considered a new version of SATKIT. See
  [Versioning](#versioning) above.
- `devel` is the main development branch. New features are added by branching
  from devel, working on the feature branch, and merging back to devel before
  creating a release branch that will be merged in to main to do the actual
  release.
- Feature branches are used to develop a major feature. They may have
  subbranches as needed.
- Release branches are branched from `devel` when all of the features for a
  release have been implemented and merged back to `devel`. After creating the
  release branch, `main` is merged in to the release branch and any problems
  ironed out before creating the actual release by merging into main. If any
  commits need to be made before merging into `main`, a merge back to `devel`
  needs to also be done.
- Hotfix branches can be branched off of any branch, but especially if branched
  from main they need to eventually be merged to both main *and* devel.
  Hotfixes are always small bug fixes never major features.

### Making a release

A release of SATKIT is created as follows:

1. If planning a major or minor release (first or second version number
   increments), check that all features in the current roadmap are either
   done (implemented and merged to local `devel`), or that all undone features are
   moved to the next release's roadmap.
   - This applies from version 1.0. Before that the roadmap is for 1.0 and
     minor releases are done when significant parts have been updated without
     fulfilling all of the promises in the roadmap.
   - This is done in the `devel` branch.
2. Send a pull request to the main repo either before or after the next stage.
   After the pull request has been processed rest of the release tasks are done
   in the main repo.
3. Update documentation and version numbers
   - Version number lives in at least README.md and constants.py. File version
     number will be different from program version number after 1.0.
     - [README](../README.md)
     - [constants.py](../satkit/constants.py)
     - Setuptools files
       - [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) and/or [setup.cfg](../setup.cfg)
   - [Release notes](Release_notes.markdown)
   - [Generated documentation](../devel/doc_generation_commands)
   - [License headers](../devel/licenseheaders_command)
4. Create a new release candidate branch named 'vX.Y.Z' e.g. 'v0.7.0' from the
   `devel` branch.
5. Merge `main` to the release branch (not the other way around).
6. Check that conda environments are up-to-date. It is especially possible that
   satkit-stable is neither up to date with satkit-devel, nor tested.
   - While we are in the time before 1.0, satkit-stable most likely does not
     work.
7. Run tests.
   - These don't exist yet at the time of SATKIT 0.9.0.
8. Fix any bugs that occur, run tests see that they pass, update the release
   notes.
   - Check if [Release notes](Release_notes.markdown) need any final updates.
   - Rerun doc generation if there were any changes.
9. Merge release branch to `main`.
10. Release housekeeping: 
    - Delete the now defunct release branch (`git push -d <remote_name>
   <branchname>` and `git branch -d <branchname`)
    - Tag the commit in main with the release title ('vX.Y.Z') and push it to
      remote with `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
    - If any commits were made to the release branch, merge `main` into `devel`.
11. Announce the release.
