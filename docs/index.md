# SATKIT Documentation

Until the 1.0 release none of the documentation is necessarily final nor correct.

## Setup

- Seting SATKIT up for analysis is currently covered by setting up for development:
- [Set SATKIT up for development](SetupForDevelopment.markdown)

## GUI Userguide

[To be written.]

## Commandline Userguide

[To be written] but already available in a rudimentary form by running
`python satkit.py --help`
