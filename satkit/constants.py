"""
This module contains all sorts of constants used by SATKIT.

Enums are used for constants that need to be instantiated from other variables.
They maybe used as fields in other objects. Using an Enum limits the possible
values and avoids typos and makes an IDE help in writing code.

Frozen dataclasses are used for constants that only ever need to be accessed
and never are stored. In effect, they function as look-up tables.
