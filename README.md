# Speech Articulation ToolKIT - SATKIT

![SATKIT GUI](docs/SATKIT_UI.png)

Tools for processing speech data. While currently these tools mainly work on
tongue and larynx ultrasound as well as audio, in future, the toolkit will
include facilities for processing other kinds of articulatory data. The first
two tools to be implemented are Optical Flow and Pixel Difference.

Optical Flow tracks local changes in ultrasound frames and estimates
the flow field based on these.

Pixel Difference and Scanline Based Pixel Difference -- work on raw,
uniterpolated data and produce measures of change over the course of a
recording. How they work is explained in Chapter 3 of Pertti Palo's
[PhD
thesis](https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/10163). The
next stage is a automated reaction time measure, followed possibly by
spline distance measures and optic flow.

## Major update -- version 1.0 -- coming up

After ICPhS 2023 there will be incremental 0.x releases until the codebase
reaches milestones for version 1.0 (See [Roadmap](docs/Roadmap.markdown)). While
this notice is here in the main branch, that update is not yet complete. In the
meanwhile, if you wish to try SATKIT or contribute to the code or as a beta
tester, please contact Pertti for instructions.

With version 1.0 getting closer a lot of the instructions below are outdated.
More up-to-date information can be found in the
[Documentation](https://giuthas.github.io/satkit/). See
[Roadmap](docs/Roadmap.markdown) for updates on progress towards 1.0.

See [Release notes](docs/Release_notes.markdown), for what's new.

## Getting Started

Download the repository to either a subdirectory of the project you
want to use the tools on or a suitable place that you then add to your
$PYTHONPATH.

### Requisites

SATKit has been tested with the following or more recent:

* Python 3.10
* PyQt5 v5.12
* MatPlotLib 3.5
* NumPy 1.22
* OpenCV 4.5
* SciPy 1.3
* praat-textgrids 1.3

A handy way of getting MatPlotLib, NumPy, and SciPy is to get them as part of
the [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Using
mamba as the environment manager when creating virtual environments is
recommended because conda may not manage to solve the dependencies and may
refuse to install anything.

Note: If you decide to use Anaconda, you should install any additional packages
you are getting with mamba (or conda) before installing praat-textgrids with pip
*as the final step* of setting up a virtual environment.

For OF you will need in addition:

* DIPY 1.5

For processing lip videos:

* Scikit-video 1.1

### Installing for regular use

An installation through pypi is in the works. Do get in touch if you
would like to *test* it.

A downloadable executable will hopefully also become reality. Do get in touch if
you would like to *develop* it.

### Installing for development

To install all of the above and create a conda environment to run SATKIT in
first install anaconda from the link above. Then install mamba because anaconda
is unlikely to solve the dependencies correctly. Do this on the command line
with: `conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge`

After you've (possibly forked and) cloned the repository from github with your
favourite git tool, cd into the repository root. There you should find the file
called `satkit_devel_conda_env.yaml` and `satkit_stable_conda_env.yaml`.

#### Using SATKIT as a library in program development

If you are not going to work on SATKIT itself, you should setup the stable
environment. To install the required packages and create the environment, run:
`mamba env create -f satkit_stable_conda_env.yaml`

Activate the environment with `conda activate satkit-stable` and the basics are
set up. If you want to have an editable install (changing code in the repo
changes behaviour of the installed SATKIT immediately) run finally `pip install
-e .` or `python3 -m pip install --editable .` if you prefer being explicit.

#### Working on SATKIT

If you plan on working on SATKIT, run the commands
`mamba env create -f satkit_devel_conda_env.yaml` and
`conda activate satkit-devel` instead of the ones above.

### What's included

See
[MANIFEST.markdown](https://github.com/giuthas/satkit/blob/master/MANIFEST.markdown)
for a description of the contents.

### Running the examples

There are three small datasets included in the distribution. You can
run tests on them with the test script `pd_test.py`. Currently the
following work and produce a new spaghetti_plot.pdf and a transcript
in `[method_name].log`.

``` shell
python satkit.py tongue_data_1_1
```

The first example directory contains recordings with all files present
while the second is intentionally missing some files. The latter case
should therefore produce warnings in the resulting log. Running
without the exclusion list specified should produce a plot with a
couple more curves in it.

The routines to deal with a directory structure like that of `test2`
are yet to be implemented.

## Running the tests

Proper testing is yet to be implemented.

## Contributing

Please, read the docs and get in touch with [Pertti](https://taurlin.org), if
you would like to contribute to the project.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning under the rules as
set out by [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) with
the additional understanding that releases before 1.0 (i.e. current
releases at time of writing) have not been tested in any way.

For the versions available, see the [tags on this
repository](https://github.com/giuthas/satkit/tags).
